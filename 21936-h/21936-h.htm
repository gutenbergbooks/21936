    <h2>
      ACTORS' DESCRIPTION OF CHARACTERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret Chalmers. Twenty-seven years of age; a strong, mature woman, but
      quite feminine where her heart or sense of beauty are concerned. Her eyes
      are wide apart. Has a dazzling smile, which she knows how to use on
      occasion. Also, on occasion, she can be firm and hard, even cynical An
      intellectual woman, and at the same time a very womanly woman, capable of
      sudden tendernesses, flashes of emotion, and abrupt actions. She is a
      finished product of high culture and refinement, and at the same time
      possesses robust vitality and instinctive right-promptings that augur well
      for the future of the race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Howard Knox. He might have been a poet, but was turned politician.
      Inflamed with love for humanity. Thirty-five years of age. He has his
      vision, and must follow it. He has suffered ostracism because of it, and
      has followed his vision in spite of abuse and ridicule. Physically, a
      well-built, powerful man. Strong-featured rather than handsome. Very much
      in earnest, and, despite his university training, a trifle awkward in
      carriage and demeanor, lacking in social ease. He has been elected to
      Congress on a reform ticket, and is almost alone in fight he is making. He
      has no party to back him, though he has a following of a few independents
      and insurgents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Chalmers. Forty-five to fifty years of age. Iron-gray mustache.
      Slightly stout. A good liver, much given to Scotch and soda, with a weak
      heart. Is liable to collapse any time. If anything, slightly lazy or
      lethargic in his emotional life. One of the "owned" senators representing
      a decadent New England state, himself master of the state political
      machine. Also, he is nobody's fool. He possesses the brain and strength of
      character to play his part. His most distinctive feature is his
      temperamental opportunism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Thomas Chalmers. Six years of age. Sturdy and healthy despite his
      grandmother's belief to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellery Jackson Hubbard. Thirty-eight to forty years of age. Smooth-shaven.
      A star journalist with a national reputation; a large, heavy-set man, with
      large head, large hands&mdash;everything about him is large. A man
      radiating prosperity, optimism and selfishness. Has no morality whatever.
      Is a conscious individualist, cold-blooded, pitiless, working only for
      himself, and believing in nothing but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Starkweather. An elderly, well preserved gentleman, slenderly
      built, showing all the signs of a man who has lived clean and has been
      almost an ascetic. One to whom the joys of the flesh have had little
      meaning. A cold, controlled man whose one passion is for power.
      Distinctively a man of power. An eagle-like man, who, by keenness of brain
      and force of character, has carved out a fortune of hundreds of millions.
      In short, an industrial and financial magnate of the first water and of
      the finest type to be found in the United States. Essentially a moral man,
      his rigid New England morality has suffered a sea change and developed
      into the morality of the master-man of affairs, equally rigid, equally
      uncompromising, but essentially Jesuitical in that he believes in doing
      wrong that right may come of it. He is absolutely certain that
      civilization and progress rest on his shoulders and upon the shoulders of
      the small group of men like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Starkweather. Of the helpless, comfortably stout, elderly type. She
      has not followed her husband in his moral evolution. She is the creature
      of old customs, old prejudices, old New England ethics. She is rather
      confused by the modern rush of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Connie Starkweather. Margaret's younger sister, twenty years old. She is
      nothing that Margaret is, and everything that Margaret is not. No
      essential evil in her, but has no mind of her own&mdash;hopelessly a
      creature of convention. Gay, laughing, healthy, buxom&mdash;a natural
      product of her care-free environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feux Dobleman. Private secretary to Anthony Starkweather. A young man of
      correct social deportment, thoroughly and in all things just the sort of
      private secretary a man like Anthony Starkweather would have. He is a
      weak-souled creature, timorous, almost effeminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Linda Davis. Maid to Margaret. A young woman of twenty-five or so, blond,
      Scandinavian, though American-born. A cold woman, almost featureless
      because of her long years of training, but with a hot heart deep down, and
      characterized by an intense devotion to her mistress. Wild horses could
      drag nothing from her where her mistress is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Junus Rutland. Having no strong features about him, the type realizes
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Gifford. A labor agitator. A man of the people, rough-hewn, narrow as
      a labor-leader may well be, earnest and sincere. He is a proper, better
      type of labor-leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matsu Sakari. Secretary of Japanese Embassy. He is the perfection of
      politeness and talks classical book-English. He bows a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolores Ortega. Wife of Peruvian Minister; bright and vivacious, and uses
      her hands a great deal as she talks, in the Latin-American fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dowsett. Fifty years of age; well preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dowsett. Stout and middle-aged.

      ACT I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF SENATOR CHALMERS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scene. <i>In Senator Chalmers' home. It is four o'clock in the afternoon,
      in a modern living room with appropriate furnishings. In particular, in
      front, on left, a table prepared for the serving of tea, all excepting the
      tea urn itself. At rear, right of center, is main entrance to the room.
      Also, doorways at sides, on left and right. Curtain discloses Chalmers and
      Hubbard seated loungingly at the right front.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /> <b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>After an apparent pause for cogitation.</i>) I can't understand why an
      old wheel-horse like Elsworth should kick over the traces that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Disgruntled. Thinks he didn't get his fair share of plums out of the
      Tariff Committee. Besides, it's his last term. He's announced that he's
      going to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Snorting contemptuously, mimicking an old man's pompous enunciation.</i>)
      "A Resolution to Investigate the High Cost of Living!"&mdash;old Senator
      Elsworth introducing a measure like that! The old buck!&mdash;&mdash; How
      are you going to handle it?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's already handled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Pulling his mustache.</i>) Turned it over to the Committee to Audit
      and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Grinning his appreciation.</i>) And you're chairman. Poor old
      Elsworth. This way to the lethal chamber, and the bill's on its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsworth will be retired before it's ever reported. In the meantime, say
      after a decent interval, Senator Hodge will introduce another resolution
      to investigate the high cost of living. It will be like Elsworth's, only
      it won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Nodding his head and anticipating.</i>) And it will go to the
      Committee on Finance and come back for action inside of twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      By the way, I see <i>Cartwright's Magazine</i> has ceased muck-raking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cartwrights</i> never did muck-rake&mdash;that is, not the big
      Interests&mdash;only the small independent businesses that didn't
      advertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it deftly concealed its reactionary tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And from now on the concealment will be still more deft. I've gone into it
      myself. I have a majority of the stock right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought I had noticed a subtle change in the last two numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Nodding.</i>) We're still going on muck-raking. We have a splendid
      series on Aged Paupers, demanding better treatment and more sanitary
      conditions. Also we are going to run "Barbarous Venezuela" and show up
      thoroughly the rotten political management of that benighted country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Nods approvingly, and, after a pause.</i>) And now concerning Knox.
      That's what I sent for you about. His speech comes off tomorrow per
      schedule. At last we've got him where we want him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have the ins and outs of it pretty well. Everything's arranged. The boys
      have their cue, though they don't know just what's going to be pulled off;
      and this time to-morrow afternoon their dispatches will be singing along
      the wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Firmly and harshly.</i>) This man Knox must be covered with ridicule,
      swamped with ridicule, annihilated with ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to laugh. Trust the great American people for that. We'll make those
      little Western editors sit up. They've been swearing by Knox, like a
      little tin god. Roars of laughter for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you do anything yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Trust me. I have my own article for Cartwright's blocked out. They're
      holding the presses for it. I shall wire it along hot-footed to-morrow
      evening. Say&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>After a pause.</i>) Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn't it a risky thing to give him his chance with that speech?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only feasible thing. He never has given us an opening. Our
      service men have camped on his trail night and day. Private life as
      unimpeachable as his public life. But now is our chance. The gods have
      given him into our hands. That speech will do more to break his influence&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Interrupting.</i>) Than a Fairbanks cocktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Both laugh.</i>) But don't forget that this Knox is a live wire.
      Somebody might get stung. Are you sure, when he gets up to make that
      speech, that he won't be able to back it up?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      No danger at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are hooks and crooks by which facts are sometimes obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Positively.</i>) Knox has nothing to go on but suspicions and hints,
      and unfounded assertions from the yellow press.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Man-servant enters, goes to tea-table, looks it over, and makes slight
      rearrangements.</i>) (<i>Lowering his voice.</i>) He will make himself a
      laughing stock. His charges will turn into boomerangs. His speech will be
      like a sheet from a Sunday supplement, with not a fact to back it up. (<i>Glances
      at Servant.</i>) We'd better be getting out of here. They're going to have
      tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The Servant, however, makes exit.</i>) Come to the library and have a
      high-ball. (<i>They pause as Hubbard speaks.</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>With quiet glee.</i>) And to-morrow Ali Baba gets his.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ali Baba?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      That's what your wife calls him&mdash;Knox.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, I believe I've heard it before. It's about time he hanged
      himself, and now we've given him the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Hubbard</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Sinking voice and becoming deprecatingly confidential. </i>)

      ran into a go-cart. Our chauffeur was not to blame. It was the woman's
      fault. She tried to cross just as we were turning the corner. But we
      hardly grazed it. Fortunately the baby was not hurt&mdash;only spilled. It

    <p>

      And I dreamed that I, too, might do something to bring on the era of
      universal justice and fair play. In my heart I dedicated myself to the
      cause of humanity. I made Lincoln my hero-he still is. But I was only a
      girl, and where was I to find this cause?&mdash;how to work for it? I was
      shut in by a thousand restrictions, hedged in by a thousand conventions.
      Everybody laughed at me when I expressed the thoughts that burned in me.
      What could I do? I was only a woman. I had neither vote nor right of
      utterance. I must remain silent. I must do nothing. Men, in their lordly
      wisdom, did all. They voted, orated, governed. The place for women was in
      the home, taking care of some lordly man who did all these lordly things.

      phrase. Power was what I needed. But how? I was a woman. Again I dreamed
      my dream&mdash;a modified dream. Only by marriage could I win to power.
      And there you have the clew to me and what I am and have become. I met the
      man who was to become my husband. He was clean and strong and an athlete,
      an outdoor man, a wealthy man and a rising politician. Father told me that
      if I married him he would make him the power of his state, make him
      governor, send him to the United States Senate. And there you have it all.

    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Margaret</b>

    <p>
      I married. I found that there were greater forces at work than I had ever
      dreamed of. They took my husband away from me and molded him into the
      political lieutenant of my father. And I was without power. I could do
      nothing for the cause. I was beaten. Then it was that I got a new vision.
      The future belonged to the children. There I could play my woman's part. I
      was a mother. Very well. I could do no better than to bring into the world
      a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome, clean,
      noble, and alive. Did I do my part well, through him the results would be
      achieved. Through him would the work of the world be done in making the
      world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it. I played
      the mother's part. That is why I left the pitiful little charities of the
      church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform,
      established my kindergartens, and worked for the little men and women who
      come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar.

      You will find the solution in the drink traffic. It is liquor, alcohol,
      that is undermining our industry, our institutions, our faith in God&mdash;everything.
      Yearly the working people drink greater quantities of alcohol. Naturally,
      through resulting inefficiency, the cost of production is higher, and
      therefore prices are higher.

      called Tom and Mr. Hubbard to him and they held a conference. I think they
      have discovered the loss of the documents, and that they believe you have
      them. I did not hear them mention your name, yet I am absolutely certain
      that they were talking about you. Also, I could tell from father's face
      that something was terribly wrong. Oh, be careful! Do be careful!

      prevailing. But again and again, by what you are doing, have you awakened

    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Knox</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Sadly.</i>) Almost&mdash;and for a few wild moments, quite. There are
      all the children. Did I ever tell you of the tenement child, who when
      asked how he knew when spring came, answered: When he saw the saloons put
      up their swing doors.

    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Margaret</b>

    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we loved&mdash;you and I; suppose we loosed all the reins of our
      love. What would happen? You remember Gorki, the Russian patriot, when he
      came to New York, aflame with passion for the Russian revolution. His
      purpose in visiting the land of liberty was to raise funds for that
      revolution. And because his marriage to the woman he loved was not of the
      essentially legal sort worshiped by the shopkeepers, and because the
      newspapers made a sensation of it, his whole mission was brought to
      failure. He was laughed and derided out of the esteem of the American
      people. That is what would happen to me. I should be slandered and laughed
      at. My power would be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Margaret</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      And even if so&mdash;what of it? Be slandered and laughed at. We will have
      each other. Other men will rise up to lead the people, and leading the
      people is a thankless task. Life is so short. We must clutch for the
      morsel of happiness that may be ours.

      Scene. <i>The library, used as a sort of semi-office by Starkweather at
      such times when he is in Washington. Door to right; also, door to right
      rear. At left rear is an alcove, without hangings, which is dark. To left
      are windows. To left, near windows, a fiat-top desk, with desk-chair and
      desk-telephone. Also, on desk, conspicuously, is a heavy dispatch box. At
      the center rear is a large screen. Extending across center back of room
      are heavy, old-fashioned bookcases, with swinging glass doors. The
      bookcases narrow about four feet from the floor, thus forming a ledge.
      Between left end of bookcases and alcove at left rear, high up on wall,
      hangs a large painting or steel engraving of Abraham Lincoln. In design
      and furnishings, it is a simple chaste room, coldly rigid and slightly
      old-fashioned.</i>

      You will substantiate them. What a chain of theft it is. My father steals
      from the people. The documents that prove his stealing are stolen by
      Gherst. Hubbard steals them from you and returns them to my father. And I
      steal them from my father and pass them back to you.

      Dear man, I didn't do it for you. I wasn't brave enough. I should have
      given in. I don't mind confessing that I started to do it for you, but it
      soon grew so terrible that I was afraid. It grew so terrible that had it
      been for you alone I should have surrendered. But out of the terror of it
      all I caught a wider vision, and all that you said last night rose before
      me. And I knew that you were right. I thought of all the people, and of
      the little children. I did it for them, after all. You speak for them. I
      stole the papers so that you could use them in speaking for the people.
      Don't you see, dear man?

      you know what they did to me? The servants were called in, and by them I
      was stripped before everybody&mdash;my family, Hubbard, the Reverend Mr.

      But it is a great social and cosmic process. It does not depend on one

      the morality of the Church was a pretense. Far deeper than it, and vastly
      more powerful, was the morality of the dollar. My father, my family, my

      don't imagine you will make a scandal.

      <br /><br /><b>Knox</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      I hadn't that in mind, but now that you mention it, it seems to the point.
      That heart of yours isn't going to carry you much farther. You have played
      fast and loose with it as with everything else. You are like the carter
      who steals hay from his horse that he may gamble. You have stolen from
      your heart. Some day, soon, like the horse, it will quit We can afford to
      wait. It won't be long.

    <p>
      <br /><br /><b>Chalmers</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>After laughing incredulously and sipping his whiskey.</i>) Well, Knox,
      neither of us wins. You don't get the woman. Neither do I. She remains
      under my roof, and I fancy that is about all. I won't divorce her. What's
      the good? But I've got her tied hard and fast by Tommy. You won't get her.

      (<i>Margaret neither moves nor answers.</i>) I say, Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>He stands up and moves toward her, holding whiskey glass in one hand.</i>)
      That speech is going to make a devil of a row. But I don't think it will
      be so bad as your father says. It looks pretty dark, but such things blow
      over. They always do blow over. And so with you and me. Maybe we can
      manage to forget all this and patch it up somehow.
